// Façade that connects the browser's WebViewClient callbacks to the Quiver Guard
// engine. All methods are safe to call from any thread; they delegate to
// QuiverGuardEngine, which handles the native adblock-rust handle's thread-safety
// internally (see its kdoc for the read/write locking rationale).
//
// Cosmetic filtering (buildCosmeticFilterScript/buildDocumentStartScript) hands out
// the *same* static script for every page, rather than one precomputed per-URL. The
// script fetches its own page-specific data at the moment it runs, through the
// bridge object installed on the WebView (see QuiverGuardJsBridge), instead of
// receiving it as precomputed arguments. That fixed a real bug: the previous design
// computed a page-specific script via a native engine call on a background thread,
// then registered it with WebViewCompat.addDocumentStartJavaScript - but that API
// only takes effect starting with the *next* navigation after it's called, and by
// the time the async computation finished, the current navigation had already
// passed its own document-start point.
//
// That fix alone turned out not to be enough, though - see [installEarly]. Both
// addJavascriptInterface (the bridge) and addDocumentStartJavaScript (the script
// itself) share the same "next navigation" limitation, independent of how fast or
// slow the Kotlin side computing their content is. Registering either one
// reactively, in response to onPageStarted, is *always* one navigation behind - not
// a slow-async-call problem, a fundamentally-too-late problem - which is why a
// WebView's first-ever page load (a fresh tab, or every tab after an app restart)
// kept showing unfiltered content even after the script itself became instant to
// compute. [installEarly] is the actual fix: call it once, when the WebView is
// created, before there's any navigation for "next navigation" to be relative to.

     * this "faster" from onPageStarted; a callback reacting to a navigation can never win a race
     * against that same navigation's own document-start point. It's calling it before there's
     * any navigation to race against.

     * This also happens to be what makes iframes work correctly without any special-casing:
     * addDocumentStartJavaScript's "*" origin rule already applies to every frame, and since the
     * registration now predates *any* navigation in this WebView, that includes frames a page
     * creates dynamically well after its own load - each just runs the same script, at its own
     * document-start, looking up its own location.href.
