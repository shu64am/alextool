/**
 * A minimal, read-only bridge letting injected JS fetch its own cosmetic-filtering data instead
 * of receiving it precomputed as script arguments.
 *
 * The document-start script (quiver_guard_cosmetic.js) is registered once, statically, the same
 * for every page - see [QuiverGuardWebIntegration] for why: computing a page-specific script in
 * Kotlin ahead of time meant a native engine call had to complete, on a background thread,
 * before the *current* navigation reached its document-start point, which - especially for the
 * very first navigation in a fresh WebView - it systematically couldn't win. Fetching through
 * this bridge instead means the script that ends up running doesn't matter; whichever one is
 * registered when a page starts just looks up *that* page's own URL at the moment it executes.
 *
 * This is registered on every WebView Quiver Guard touches (see
 * [QuiverGuardWebIntegration.ensureBridgeInstalled]), which means every method here is callable
 * by *any* JavaScript running in that WebView, not just Quiver Guard's own injected script -
 * including whatever a malicious or compromised page runs. It's deliberately narrow: every
 * method just answers "what do the user's own (already on-device, already public) filter list
 * rules say about this specific URL/these specific tokens" - the same information a page can
 * already infer by noticing its own ad slots are hidden or its own tracking params get stripped.
 * Nothing here can modify browser state, read other data, or touch the filesystem.
