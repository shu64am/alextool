/**
 * Fires when [DownloadScheduleMonitor]'s next window boundary is reached, and reconciles queued
 * downloads against it. A plain inexact [android.app.AlarmManager] alarm firing a
 * [android.content.BroadcastReceiver] is not one of Android 12+'s documented exemptions from the
 * "no starting foreground services from the background" restriction, so calling
 * [DownloadForegroundService.start] from such a receiver while the app is backgrounded can throw
 * silently and leave nothing running. [CoroutineWorker.setForeground] is WorkManager's own
 * sanctioned path to that same foreground state, so by the time [reconcile] asks
 * [DownloadForegroundService] to start, this process is already legitimately foregrounded and that
 * nested start succeeds.
 *
 * The process may not otherwise be running at this point, so this first ensures [AlexToolDownloadManager]
 * has loaded its persisted state before reconciling, the same ordering [DownloadBootReceiver] uses.
